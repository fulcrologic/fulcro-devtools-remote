== Devtools Remote

Alpha quality. Some internals subject to change.

Devtools Remote supplies a Fulcro Remote abstraction that can be used for developing development tooling using Fulcro for the UI of the tool, such that the communication to the target of the tooling acts simply as a Fulcro remote where mutations, loads, and "server push" is supported without you having to write that plumbing.

The use cases are:

* A Chrome Extension that creates one or more panels (using Fulcro) and the target is any web-page based application (doesn't have to be Fulcro).
* An Electron app whose UI is written in Fulcro, and talks over websockets to "whatever" using the Sente websockets library.

The target app can be anything that can run Sente as a Server (CLJC). Pathom is the suggested library for implementing the code on the target that your Devtool will talk to.

IF The target of your tool is a Fulcro application (as it is for Fulcro Inspect), then there is a little additional tooling where you can install an extra dev-time remote on your target application so that the Target can initiate communications with the Tool. Thus you'd have:

[d2]
-----
Target 1 (Fulcro) <-> Dev Tool (Fulcro): EQL
Target 2 (Fulcro) <-> Dev Tool (Fulcro): EQL
Target 3 (Fulcro) <-> Dev Tool (Fulcro): EQL
-----

but the goal of this library is to let your target by anything that you can talk over the protocol.

=== Chrome

The goal is that your mental model is this:

[d2]
-----
Fulcro UI (Chrome Extension) <-> CLJS running in Web Page: Fulcro remote: EQL
-----

even though a Chrome extensions require transferring the message through multiple hops for security. The devtool has to run a background worker, which can communicate to/from either the extension or the page, but this communication is done via ports and on-page events of the target web page.

So, in reality, the comms look more like this:

[d2]
-----
Chrome Extension 1 <-> Background Worker: port (transit string)
Chrome Extension 2 <-> Background Worker: port (transit string)
Chrome Extension 3 <-> Background Worker: port (transit string)
Background Worker <-> Content Script 1: port (transit string)
Background Worker <-> Content Script 2: port (transit string)
Background Worker <-> Content Script 3: port (transit string)
Content Script 1 <-> Target CLJS 1: js event
Content Script 1 <-> Target CLJS 2: js event
Content Script 2 <-> Target CLJS 3: js event
Content Script 3 <-> Target CLJS 4: js event
-----

=== Electron

The same as chrome, but different communication bits. We
want you to see:

[d2]
-----
Fulcro UI (Electron UI) <-> CLJ(s) Program: Fulcro remote
-----

when in reality the chain of communication is:

[d2]
-----
Electron UI <-> Background: IPC
Background <-> This Library: websockets
This Library <-> Target Code
-----
